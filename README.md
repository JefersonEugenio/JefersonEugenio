### About me

My name is Jeferson, I'm deaf, I'm 31 years old, I live in Canoas - RS - Brazil and I like football, I support Inter, I really like programming.

I currently work as an academic for [DB](https://db.tec.br/) at home working.

I have knowledge with automated web testing and Java with Selenium, basic using Python with RobotFramework and also with web development. And learning Nuxt.js and Typescript.

I am studying higher education in Systems Analysis and Development at the Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Sul.

A curious thing about me is that I have a hearing impairment, but I always dedicate myself well to my work and my daily life.
